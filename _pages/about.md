Cheng is born in Tokyo and moved to Shanghai to live with his family until high school. After graduating from BA(Hons) Graphic Communication Design, Central Saint Martins College of Design in London, he came to Japan to fullfill his dream of being a designer and learn more about himself.

He believes that curiosity and harmony are essential elements that facilitate good design, as they align with how humans perceive the world. In his personal projects, he approaches design as conducting a symphony, weaving together elements to tell a compelling story. When collaborating with clients, he thrives on problem-solving, breaking down communication barriers, and creating visually appealing solutions.
